Swing Failure Pattern (SFP)

TL;DR:

There's liquidity (pending orders) above/below deep swing points. Price will often trade through that swing point and come back. Pros get their liquidity & traders get trapped.

P.S. not the best example in the world as deeper swings with more space tend to attract more orders, but hopefully makes the concept clear anyway

The deeper the swing (stands out more, espec on higher time frames) the more likely that traders see it = more orders around it
